## Focus.

I create and breathe for exceptional user experiences. The projects I work on display a high level of craftsmanship, potential for a long-lasting social impact on scale, and have founders with great learning velocity. I prefer areas most people find boring, e.g. B2B, numbers, or hard technology.

### Moonshots.

Projects I aspire to work on in the future.

- Biotechnology.
- Climate tech.
- Nomad citizenship.
- Public infrastructure.
- Sustainable energy.
- Tools for professionals.
